                    <h3>Legal, Business, and Broad Experience You Can Rely On</h3>
                    <p>I began my legal career at <strong>Baker & McKenzie</strong>, supporting international energy transactions and corporate finance deals. I later worked with the <strong>Environmental Integrity Project</strong>, where I focused on Clean Air and Clean Water Act enforcement, and consulted on energy policy for <strong>Sandia National Laboratories</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Seeking a more mission-aligned practice, I launched my firm, <strong>Seattle Legal Advisor</strong>, in 2011. I now work with clients across Washington State on business law, M&A, intellectual property, estate planning, and real estate matters—especially for entrepreneurs, creatives, closely held businesses, and nonprofits.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my law practice, I've owned and operated several businesses, including a property management company. As a landlord myself, I offer clients grounded legal advice informed by real experience—whether they're buying their first rental or scaling a real estate business.</p>

                    <h3>Civic Engagement and Strategic Leadership</h3>
                    <p>Since 2008, I've led the work that became <strong>Resident Participation Services ("RPS")</strong>, a civic engagement and election services firm that helps public housing authorities run fair, inclusive elections and strengthen local governance.</p>
